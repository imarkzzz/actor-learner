# Think Algorithm When coding
1. What are some of the primitive operations that a computer can perform?
2. How much time does it take to perform these primitive operations?
3. What does the term computational complexity mean?
4. Why do we care about computational complexity?
5. When do we need to be conerned about about the complexity of a piece of code?
6. What can we do to improve the efficiency of a piece of code?
7. What is the definition of Big-Oh notation?
8. What is the definition of Theta notation?
9. What is amortized complexity and what is its importance?
10. How can we apply what we learned to make the PyList container class better?
